'''
You are given an array A containing N integers. The special product of each ith integer in this array is defined as the product of the following:<ul>

LeftSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] (i>j). If multiple A[j]â€™s are present in multiple positions, the LeftSpecialValue is the maximum value of j.

RightSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] (j>i). If multiple A[j]s are present in multiple positions, the RightSpecialValue is the minimum value of j.

Write a program to find the maximum special product of any integer in the array.

Input: You will receive array of integers as argument to function.

Return: Maximum special product of any integer in the array modulo 1000000007.

Note: If j does not exist, the LeftSpecialValue and RightSpecialValue are considered to be 0.

Constraints 1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Ex: [ 6, 7, 9, 5, 5, 8 ] 
specialLeft = [0,0,0,2,2,2] (these are the indices)
specialRight= [1,2,0,5,5,0] (also the indices)
specialLeft * specialRight= [0,0,0,10,10,0]
specialLeft and specialRight are matrices of the indices and we need to multiply those and get the maximum result of the multiplication as the output.
